To perform the factorial analysis and reliability test, it is necessary to ensure the normality of responses on each item of the questionnaire.

## File: [cfa-model-fit.pdf](cfa-model-fit.pdf)

The factorial structure for the IMI questionnaire was validated using Confirmatory Factorial Analysis (CFA) over the [second-order-factor model](second-order-factor-model.png), [multidimensional model](multidimensional-model.png), and [bi-factor model](bi-factor-model.png). This file summarize the results of Goodness of fit statistics based on chi-square, AGFI, TLI, CFI and RMSEA values.

## File: [reliability-analysis.pdf](reliability-analysis.pdf)

After to ensure the structure of the IMI questionnaire, we carried out reliability test with the responses to ensure the consistency and trustworthy of our instrumment. This file summarize the results of the reliability tests in which the Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.70 is good, the Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.80 is better, and the Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.90 is the best.

## File: [RelAnalysis.xlsx](RelAnalysis.xlsx)

Report with the detailed information of the reliability test performed on each psychological factor of the IMI questionnaire. In addition to this information, the report included sheets about the sampling adequacy (using KMO method) and explanatory factorial analysis on the IMI questionnaire.
