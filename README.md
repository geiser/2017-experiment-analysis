* R script to winsorize extreme responses from the data gathered through the IMI and IMMS questionnaires ([02-winsorizing-extreme-motivation.R](https://github.com/geiser/phd-thesis-evaluation/blob/master/02-winsorizing-extreme-motivation.R)). Extreme responses correspond to answers given by participants who have tendency to indicate extreme lower and upper values in questionnaires. Such responses are outliers that affect the assumptions for parametric tests, but that can't simply removed to satisfy these assumptions. To reduce the impact of extreme values, they should be shrunk to the border of the main part of the data through the winsorization method.  
  - _Result_: Extreme responses on the IMI questionnaire: [winsorized-IMI.pdf](report/latex/winsorized-IMI.pdf)
